# Text-Classification
**Problem Statement**:  
Classify text documents based on sentiment or topic using machine learning.

**Data**:  
- Source: Text dataset from Google Collab
- Description: Documents labeled into different categories.

**Data Mining Operations**:  
- NLP preprocessing (lowercase, tokenization, stopword removal).
- Built a machine learning model for text classification (likely Logistic Regression or Neural Network).
- Libraries: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`
- Reason for model choice: Effective balance between performance and explainability.

**Model Outputs**:  
- Achieved classification performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).

**Limitations**:  
- Dataset size and vocabulary variability may impact model performance.

**Were you able to effectively solve the problem?**  
Yes, text classification accuracy met expectations for the dataset provided.
